  [ Maxime Hadjinlian ]
  * Initial release

  * Add the plum script feature, you can now create and use 
  plum script. You just need to specify a shebang with the

  You _MUST_ have a line with setup=(ip_or_mac ip_or_mac)
  Note : the space _IS_ important.

  * Add the -p option to show a progress bar with the script

  keyboard to cycle through your past command !
